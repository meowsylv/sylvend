# sylvend!!!!

<sub>sylveon, backend, get it? yeah i'm not really good with names</sub>

Welcome to the sylvend repository!! This tool was originally meant to be used exclusively for [my website](https://meow.sylv.cat/), but I've decided to make it more modular and release it to the public!!

# installation!!

Clone this repo and run `install` as root.

This will create the following directories in your system:

- `/usr/share/sylvend`
- `/etc/sylvend/`
- `/var/www/html`

As you probably know, /var/www/html is also the default web directory in some popular web servers, so if you have anything important there, back it up before running sylvend for the first time, as it might be overwritten. Once you're ready to run sylvend, just run `node .`

# WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS ABOMINATION????

You see, as stated before, this tool was made with my website in mind, so it has a very, VERY specific set of features, so it might be confusing to set up at first, so if you want to see some examples, just check out [my config](https://github.com/meowsylv/website)!!
